Pretty straightforward--the only tough part was implementing `grid`. Grid is something I've been dragging my feet on because of its complexity, but whenever I see it used well I'm always impressed. I managed to get it to work with this solution, but I know there's a better way. I'm going to complete Wes Bos's Grid course so I can improve...his `flexbox` course was outstanding, so if the Grid course is anything like that, I should soon be good to go with `grid`.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this four card section and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
